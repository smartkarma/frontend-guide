# Firebase analytics

## Log Events

Each event has to be defined via `Flow` in `logEvent` utility.

The param have this shape:

type EventParams = {|
  event: "name_of_event",
  params: {|
    id: string,
    step: Step,
    origin?: Origin

|};
```

> Don't forget to always put origin in Origin type, to prevent duplicates and keep track of all of
> them from one place.
