# Wordpress Introduction

!> Whenever working on wordpress project, first make sure server commited all changes to GIT. `this situation should be just temporary as it's unsustainable`

## Temporary workflow

1.  Check changes on stratus
2.  If changes made, commit to `master`
3.  Pull changes on your machine and merge from `master` to `develop`
4.  Make sure no one is updating any plugins/themes during your development.
5.  Commit and release changes as usual
6.  Pull changes to server.
